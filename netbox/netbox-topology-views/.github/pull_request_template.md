    IMPORTANT:
    ==========
    Thank you for contributing to NetBox Topology Views! Please 
    note that our contribution guidelines require a feature 
    request or bug report to be labeled "status: accepted". This 
    helps avoid waste time and effort on a proposed change that 
    we might not be able to accept. If a feature request or bug 
    report is labeled "status: needs owner", feel free to raise 
    your hand if you'd like to take work on it and we will 
    happily assign you to the issue.

    Please prefix the title of your pull request according to 
    it's type. You should use "Closes #FEATURE_ID: ..." for feature 
    requests and "Fixes #ISSUE_ID: ..." for issues. This helps 
    us closing issues automatically after merging.

    To sum it up:
    1. Create Bug Report or Feature Request
    2. Wait until the issue has been labeled "status: accepted"
    3. Start working on the issue in a seperate branch
    3. Create a pull request and name the title with a prefix 
       according to the issue ID.
